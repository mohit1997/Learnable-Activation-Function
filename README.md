# Learnable Activation Function
### A new paradigm for understanding Neural Networks

We propose \`\`Self-Learnable Activation Functions'' (SLAF), which are learned during training and are capable of approximating most of the existing activation functions. SLAF is given as a weighted sum of pre-defined basis elements which can serve for a good approximation of the optimal activation function.
