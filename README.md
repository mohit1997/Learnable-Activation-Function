# Effectiveness of Neural Networks with polynomial activations

We propose "Polynomial Activation Functions'' (PAF), which are learned during training and are capable of approximating most of the existing activation functions. PAF is given as a weighted sum of 'normalized monomials' which serve for a good approximation of the optimal activation function.
